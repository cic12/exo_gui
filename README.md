# Exoskeleton GUI

GUI and controller code template for exoskeleton control.

## Installation

A windows installation of Qt is required. The software has been developed using Desktop Qt 5.15.0 MSVC2019 64bit, so this installation is recommended. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) and is free for open source projects.

With Qt installed, the code in this repo should run straight away. The Qt project is loaded by opening the GUI.pro file.
