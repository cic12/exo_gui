## Installation

A windows installation of Qt is required to use this code. The software has been developed using Desktop Qt 5.15.0 MSVC2019 64bit, so this installation is recommended.

With Qt installed, the code in this repo should run straight away. The Qt project is loaded by opening the GUI.pro file.
