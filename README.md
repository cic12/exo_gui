# Exoskeleton GUI

GUI and controller code template for exoskeleton control.

## Installation

A windows installation of Qt is required. The software has been developed using Desktop Qt 5.15.0 MSVC2019 64bit, so this installation is recommended. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer "Qt") and is free for open source development.

With Qt installed, the code in this repo should run straight away. The Qt project is loaded by opening the GUI.pro file.
